This is a really dry tutorial on how to install Postfix and Dovecot on an Ubuntu machine. This article is intended as a checklist of all needed steps to setup a fully functional mail server. I took care not to override options with default values as it is done in may other tutorials.

## DNS records

First we need to set the DNS records. Open up the settings at your registrar and create a A record for the subdomain "mail" that points to your mail server. Verify with (expected result is the servers IP):

~~~bash
dig A mail.example.com +short  
~~~

Add a MX record and point it to the created subdomain. Verify with (expected result is mail.example.com):

~~~bash
dig MX example.com +short
~~~

Set the hostname of the server by editing the /etc/hostnames file, so the reverse DNS lookup resolves to the same domain otherwise other email providers will label you as a spammer. Verify with (expected result is mail.example.com):

~~~bash
hostname
~~~

## SLL certificates

Next you need a certificate to encrypt the communication using SLL. Get a certificate from the Let's encrypt CA using a Certbot client.

Install the client using:

~~~bash
apt-get update
apt-get install software-properties-common
add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot
apt-get update
apt-get install certbot
~~~

Obtain the certificate using the built-in webserver:

~~~bash
sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d mail.example.com --email postmaster@example.com
~~~

## Configuring Postfix

Install postfix using:

~~~bash
sudo apt-get install postfix
~~~

### Minimal config
Open /etc/postfix/main.cf and set the following options:

~~~
myhostname = mail.example.com
mydomain = example.com
myorigin = $mydomain
mydestination = $myhostname, localhost.$mydomain, localhost, $mydomain
~~~

To allow plus addressing (email sent to user+tag@example.com will be delivered to user@example.com) also add:
~~~
recipient_delimiter = +
~~~

Run the following command to reload the configuration:

~~~bash
postfix reload
~~~

Emails can now be sent and received, test with:

~~~bash
mail -s "Test" root@example.com < /dev/null
~~~

Although the postfix server is now fully functional a few more steps are needed to ensure other email providers don't label you as a spammer.

### Setup Secure SMTP

Add the following to main.cf:

~~~
smtp_tls_security_level = may
smtpd_tls_security_level = may
smtpd_tls_cert_file = /etc/letsencrypt/live/mail.example.com/cert.pem
smtpd_tls_key_file = /etc/letsencrypt/live/mail.example.com/privkey.pem
~~~

Uncomment the following line in /etc/postfix/master.cf:

~~~
submission inet n       -       y       -       -       smtpd
~~~

### Setup SPF

Add an apex TXT record with contents (replace IPX with the actual IPs):

~~~
v=spf1 a mx ip4:IP4 ip6:IP6 ~all
~~~

### Setup DKIM

Add the following to /etc/opendkim.conf:

~~~
LogWhy                yes

KeyTable              /etc/opendkim/KeyTable
SigningTable          /etc/opendkim/SigningTable
ExternalIgnoreList    /etc/opendkim/TrustedHosts
InternalHosts         /etc/opendkim/TrustedHosts
~~~

Uncomment the following line in /etc/default/opendkim:

~~~
SOCKET="inet:12345@localhost"
~~~

Append the following to main.cf:

~~~
milter_protocol = 2 
milter_default_action = accept 
smtpd_milters = inet:localhost:12345 
non_smtpd_milters = inet:localhost:12345 
~~~

Create the following directory structure:

~~~bash
mkdir /etc/opendkim
mkdir /etc/opendkim/keys
mkdir /etc/opendkim/keys/example.com
~~~

Add the following to /etc/opendkim/TrustedHosts:

~~~
127.0.0.1
localhost
example.com
~~~

Add the following to /etc/opendkim/KeyTable:

~~~
default._domainkey.example.com example.com:default:/etc/opendkim/keys/example.com/default.private
~~~

Add the following to /etc/opendkim/SigningTable:

~~~
example.com default._domainkey.example.com
~~~

Generate the keys:

~~~bash
cd /etc/opendkim/keys/example.com
opendkim-genkey -s default -d example.com
chown opendkim:opendkim default.private
~~~

Create a TXT record as specified in /etc/opendkim/keys/example.com/default.txt.

### Setup DMARC

Create a TXT record "_dmarc" with the contents:

~~~
v=DMARC1; p=none
~~~

### Setup aliases

Add the following to /etc/alliases:
~~~bash
postmaster:    root
abuse:         root
webmaster:     root
~~~

To reload the configuration run:
~~~
newaliases
~~~

### Test

All major email providers should now accept your emails. You can test this by sending an email to a gmail account. If you look at the email source, SPF, DKIM and DMARC tests gmail preforms should pass.

## Dovecot

Add the following to /etc/postfix/main.cf, so postfix can communicate with dovecot.

~~~
smtpd_sasl_type = dovecot
smtpd_sasl_path = private/auth
smtpd_sasl_auth_enable = yes
~~~

Next you need to configure dovecot. The configuration is stored in /etc/dovecot/conf.d.

To configure the SLL certificates add the following to 10-ssl.conf:

~~~
ssl = required
ssl_cert = </etc/ssl/certs/mailcert.pem
ssl_key = </etc/ssl/private/mail.key 
~~~

In 10-auth.conf uncomment the following line: 

~~~
disable_plaintext_auth = yes
~~~

In 10-master.conf add the following into the auth service block:

~~~
service auth {
  unix_listener /var/spool/postfix/private/auth {
     mode = 0660
     ## Assuming the default Postfix user and group
     user = postfix
     group = postfix        
  }
}
~~~

That is it, you can now connect to your server using an email client.
